## How to Use

For the most efficient workflow with this tool, follow these steps:

### 1. Setup Hotkey (Recommended)
- Use your operating system's hotkey manager or a third-party tool like AutoHotkey (Windows) or Keyboard Maestro (Mac)
- Create a hotkey combination (e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+R`) to launch `record_process_to_clipboard.py`
- This allows you to start recording instantly from any application

### 2. Recording Process
- When you trigger the hotkey, a simple recording window will appear
- The window contains a single "Stop Recording" button
- Speak clearly into your microphone to record your message

### 3. Transcription
- Click the "Stop Recording" button when finished
- The audio will automatically be sent to Whisper Large V3 model for transcription
- Wait a few moments while processing occurs

### 4. Using the Result
- The transcribed text is automatically copied to your clipboard
- Simply paste (`Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V`) anywhere you need the text
- No need to manually copy or save - it's ready to use immediately

This workflow allows you to quickly convert speech to text without interrupting your work process. Perfect for note-taking, drafting emails, or any situation where typing might slow you down.
